		<h3>About this project</h3>
		<p class="modal__contents-p">This project is an evolution of the White House’s JobKit initiative, which pulled together federal workforce data and use cases to spur data-driven innovation for the American worker.</p>
		<p class="modal__contents-p">We build on JobKit by incorporating insights from <a href="/">The Opportunity Project.</a> TOP is a tech accelerator led by the U.S. Census Bureau. In 12-week sprints, technologists, federal civil servants, and community advocates work together to rapidly prototype digital products—powered by federal open data—that solve real-world problems for Americans.</p>
		<p class="modal__contents-p">Teams are aided by federal data stewards from across the U.S. government, who help them identify valuable datasets for tackling specific challenges. Their recommendations are organized here. Use these insights to speed up data discovery and kick-start your own project!</p>
